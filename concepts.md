## Concepts for the game to develop

Reminder: This code is mainly for my game dev class so should NOT be treated as a product ready for publishing.

### Concept 1: 
Old western setting with futuristic weapons (future by old west standards)

### Concept 2:
Stealth game similar to "hitman world of assassination"

### Concept 3:
Destructable terrain (prob won't do)

### Concept 4:
Time based mechanics???
