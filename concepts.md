## <del>Concepts for the game to develop</del>

<del>Reminder: This code is mainly for my game dev class so should NOT be treated as a product ready for publishing.</del>


### <del>Concept 1: </del>
<del>Old western setting with futuristic weapons (future by old west standards)</del>

### <del>Concept 2:</del>
<del>Stealth game similar to "hitman world of assassination"</del>

### <del>Concept 3:</del>
<del>Destructable terrain (prob won't do)</del>

### <del>Concept 4:</del>
<del>Time based mechanics???</del>

## <del>Concept 5:</del>
<del>Stealth game where you need to collect all objects before time runs out WITHOUT being caught. Enemies will run at the player at a slightly faster speed than the player. When line of sight is broken, enemies will run to last known location to attempt to fine the player. They will stay for a few seconds then go back to their asigned patrol. Enemies can NOT be taken out. (Maybe add a temp passed out state before returining to normal (10 seconds?))</del>

## Concept 6:
Roblox obby lol
