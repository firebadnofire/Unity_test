## Concepts for the game to develop

Reminder: This code is mainly for my game dev class so should NOT be treated as a product ready for publishing.

### Concept 1: 
Old western setting with futuristic weapons (future by old west standards)

### Concept 2:
Stealth game similar to "hitman world of assassination"

### Concept 3:
Destructable terrain (prob won't do)

### Concept 4:
Time based mechanics???

## Concept 5 (DO THIS):
Stealth game where you need to collect all objects before time runs out WITHOUT being caught. Enemies will run at the player at a slightly faster speed than the player. When line of sight is broken, enemies will run to last known location to attempt to fine the player. They will stay for a few seconds then go back to their asigned patrol. Enemies can NOT be taken out. (Maybe add a temp passed out state before returining to normal (10 seconds?))
